## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py populate_sample_data
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Demo Accounts
- **Admin:** `admin` / `admin123`
- **Drivers:** `driver1`, `driver2`, `driver3` / `driver123`

## 🌟 Demo Scenario

1. **Login as Admin** (`admin` / `admin123`)
   - View dashboard with 3 trucks and statistics
   - Click "Track" on TRK001 to see location history
   - See real-time updates when drivers share location

2. **Login as Driver** (`driver1` / `driver123`)
   - View assigned truck (TRK001)
   - Click "Start Location Sharing"
   - See location updates on map
   - Navigate through the interface

3. **Real-time Interaction**
   - Open both admin and driver dashboards
   - Start location sharing from driver app
   - Watch real-time updates appear on admin dashboard
